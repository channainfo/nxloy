## 13. Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Risk #1: AI/ML Requires Data Scale
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: High

**Mitigation**:
- Start with small pilot (50 customers) to gather data
- Use synthetic data for initial training
- Partner with existing brands to access historical data
- Offer incentives for data sharing (free AI features)

---

### Risk #2: Gamification May Not Fit All Industries
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation**:

- Provide traditional loyalty option

### Risk #3: Sustainability Features May Have Low Adoption
**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation**:

---

### Risk #4: BNPL Regulatory Changes
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation**:
- Monitor CFPB regulations closely

- Diversify revenue streams (not dependent on BNPL fees)

---

### Risk #5: Blockchain/NFT Hype Cycle Cooling
**Probability**: High
**Impact**: Low (Phase 4, not critical path)

**Mitigation**:
- NFTs are Phase 4, not MVP
- Focus on real utility (membership, rewards), not speculation
- Custodial wallets for non-crypto users
- If adoption low, pivot to other emerging features
