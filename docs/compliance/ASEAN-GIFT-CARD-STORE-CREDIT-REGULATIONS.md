- Minimum 5-year expiration
- No dormancy fees for first year

## 10. KEY QUESTIONS ANSWERED

### Are gift cards regulated differently from store credit in ASEAN?

**YES - Critical Distinction**:

1. **Purchased Gift Cards** (cash consideration):
   - Philippines: Heavily regulated (no expiration, DTI oversight)
   - Singapore: May require licensing if multi-purpose
   - Other ASEAN: Minimal specific regulation

2. **Store Credit / Loyalty Rewards** (promotional/limited purpose):
   - Philippines: **EXEMPT** from Gift Check Act
   - Singapore: **EXEMPT** from Payment Services Act licensing (limited purpose e-money exclusion)
   - Most ASEAN: Favorable treatment or unregulated

**NxLoy Implication**: Structure as loyalty/rewards program, not gift cards for sale

### What are expiration requirements?

| Country | Purchased Gift Cards | Loyalty/Rewards |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Philippines** | **NO EXPIRATION** | Expiration allowed (exempt) |
| **Singapore** | Provider discretion | Provider discretion |
| **Cambodia** | Not regulated | Not regulated |
| **Thailand** | Not regulated | Not regulated |
| **Vietnam** | Must disclose | Must disclose |
| **Malaysia** | Not regulated | Not regulated |
| **Indonesia** | Must standardize/disclose | Must standardize/disclose |

**NxLoy Implication**: 
- As loyalty program, can set reasonable expiration (12-24 months recommended)
- Must clearly disclose expiration terms

### Are fees allowed (dormancy, service, etc.)?

**Generally YES for loyalty programs**, but:

- **Philippines**: Not prohibited for loyalty rewards
- **Singapore**: Allowed, must disclose
- **Other ASEAN**: Generally allowed with disclosure

**NxLoy Recommendation**: Avoid fees to maintain customer goodwill; if needed, clearly disclose

### How is breakage revenue treated for accounting/tax?

**Accounting (IFRS 15 / ASC 606)**:

**Breakage Recognition**:
- Recognize expected breakage revenue in proportion to pattern of rights exercised by customer
- Requires estimation of expected breakage based on historical data
- Can recognize before legal release from obligation if reliable estimate exists

**Tax Treatment**:

**Singapore GST**:
- MRV: GST at 9/109 on unredeemed amount upon expiry
- Breakage revenue is taxable

**Cambodia VAT**:
- 10% VAT likely applies to breakage revenue
- Specific guidance not available

**Philippines**:
- VAT likely applies (specific rate not confirmed in research)
- Loyalty rewards may have different treatment than purchased GCs

**NxLoy Recommendation**:
- Conservative accounting: Recognize breakage revenue at redemption or expiry
- Obtain tax rulings in each jurisdiction
- Maintain detailed redemption tracking for breakage estimation

### Are there escheatment/unclaimed property requirements?

**NO** - ASEAN countries do not have US-style escheatment laws requiring unredeemed gift card balances to revert to government.

**Singapore**: Unclaimed money laws apply to public sector agencies, not private gift card issuers

**Other ASEAN**: No escheatment requirements identified

**NxLoy Advantage**: Can recognize breakage revenue without risk of future escheatment

### What disclosures are required?

**Minimum Disclosures Across ASEAN**:

1. **Expiration dates** (if any)
2. **Fees and charges** (if any)
3. **Redemption process and limitations**
4. **Terms and conditions** (clear and conspicuous)
5. **Non-transferability** (if applicable)
6. **Non-refundability** (if applicable)

**Best Practice**:
- Disclosures in local language and English
- Easily accessible (app, website, physical card if applicable)
- Point-of-issuance disclosure
- Ongoing account balance visibility

### Are there registration or licensing requirements?

| Country | Loyalty/Rewards Program | Multi-Merchant Gift Cards |
|---------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Singapore** | **NO** (limited purpose e-money exempt) | **YES** (Payment Services Act license) |
| **Philippines** | **NO** (exempt from Gift Check Act) | **YES** (DTI oversight) |
| **Cambodia** | Likely **NO** | Possibly (NBC oversight) |
| **Thailand** | Likely **NO** | Possibly (BOT oversight) |
| **Vietnam** | Likely **NO** | Possibly (SBV oversight) |
| **Malaysia** | Likely **NO** | Possibly (BNM oversight) |
| **Indonesia** | Likely **NO** | Possibly (OJK/BI oversight) |

**NxLoy Recommendation**: 
- Structure as limited-purpose loyalty program (single brand, limited merchant network)
- Avoid multi-purpose, widely-accepted gift cards
- Monitor regulatory developments in each market

### How does this compare to US/EU regulations?

**ASEAN is LESS REGULATED than US/EU for general gift cards, but Philippines approaches California-level restriction**

**Advantages for NxLoy in ASEAN**:
1. No ASEAN-wide escheatment requirements
2. Limited gift card-specific regulations (except Philippines)
3. Loyalty program exemptions widely recognized
4. Business-friendly approach in Singapore, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia

**Disadvantages**:
1. Lack of harmonization (must comply country-by-country)
2. Evolving regulations (2024-2025 updates in many countries)
3. Philippines very restrictive for purchased gift cards
4. Unclear guidance in some jurisdictions

## 15. CONCLUSION

### Executive Summary of Findings

1. **ASEAN Regulatory Landscape**: Highly fragmented; no harmonized gift card regulations

2. **Loyalty Program Advantage**: Structuring NxLoy as loyalty/rewards program provides significant regulatory advantages across ASEAN

3. **Most Restrictive Market**: Philippines (for purchased gift cards), but loyalty programs are EXEMPT

4. **Most Developed Framework**: Singapore (clear, business-friendly with limited-purpose exemption)

5. **Emerging Opportunity**: Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia have minimal gift card regulation but evolving digital payment frameworks

6. **Tax Treatment**: VAT/GST applies; Singapore MRV structure defers tax to redemption/expiry (favorable)

7. **No Escheatment**: Major advantage vs. US; can recognize breakage revenue without future liability

8. **Disclosure Requirements**: Transparency and fairness are universal expectations; clear terms essential

### Strategic Recommendations for NxLoy

**1. CRITICAL: Structure as Loyalty/Rewards Program**

- **NOT** gift cards for sale
- Issue as rewards for purchases, referrals, promotions
- Market as promotional tool, not stored value product

**2. Maintain Limited-Purpose Characterization**

- Redemption limited to NxLoy merchant network
- Non-withdrawable, non-refundable (except as promotional benefit)
- Avoid expansion to unrelated third-party merchants (triggers licensing)

**3. Phased Compliance Approach**

- **Priority 1**: Cambodia, Singapore (well-defined frameworks)
- **Priority 2**: Philippines (obtain DTI exemption confirmation), Vietnam
- **Priority 3**: Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia (monitor developments)

**4. Conservative Financial Practices**

- Recognize breakage revenue conservatively
- Maintain detailed redemption tracking
- Obtain tax rulings in key jurisdictions
- Prepare for potential regulatory audits

**5. Ongoing Monitoring**

- Assign compliance owner for each jurisdiction
- Quarterly regulatory review
- Participate in industry associations
- Engage with regulators proactively

### Competitive Advantages

NxLoy's multi-tenant loyalty platform can leverage:

1. **Regulatory Arbitrage**: Loyalty program exemptions across ASEAN
2. **No Escheatment**: Superior economics vs. US/EU
3. **Flexible Expiration**: Can optimize for retention vs. breakage
4. **Limited Regulation**: Faster market entry vs. heavily regulated gift card models
5. **Regional Expansion**: Scalable compliance framework

### Next Steps

1. **Legal Review**: Share this document with legal counsel in Cambodia, Singapore, Philippines
