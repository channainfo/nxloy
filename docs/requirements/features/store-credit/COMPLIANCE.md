# Store Credit Compliance & Regulatory Requirements

**Feature**: Store Credit System
**Version**: 2.0.0
**Date**: 2025-11-09
**Status**: Phase 1 - Compliance Research (ASEAN Focus)
**Owner**: NxLoy Platform Team
**Operating Context**: Cambodia (Home Base) → Singapore → ASEAN → US/EU (Reference)

## Executive Summary

**NxLoy Context**: NxLoy is based in **Cambodia** with primary expansion to **Singapore** and other ASEAN countries. This document provides compliance guidance with **ASEAN-first focus**, positioning store credit as part of a **loyalty/rewards program** to maximize regulatory exemptions.

**Key Strategic Advantages in ASEAN**:
1. **No Escheatment Requirements** - ASEAN has no US-style unclaimed property laws (major financial advantage)
2. **Loyalty Program Exemptions** - Favorable treatment across ASEAN when structured as rewards (not purchased gift cards)
3. **Limited Regulation** - Cambodia and most ASEAN markets have minimal gift card-specific laws
4. **Singapore Hub Benefits** - Clear limited-purpose exemption from Payment Services Act licensing

**Recommended Approach**: Structure store credit as **loyalty/rewards program benefit**, not as purchased gift cards, to minimize regulatory burden and maximize operational flexibility.

**Compliance Priorities**:
- **Cambodia** (Home Base): 10% VAT, general consumer protection, monitor NBC guidance
- **Singapore** (Primary Expansion): 9% GST, limited-purpose exemption, Consumer Protection Act
- **Philippines** (If expanding): Loyalty exemption from Gift Check Act (critical)
- **US/EU** (Reference Only): Included for businesses serving US/EU customers

## Overview

### What is Store Credit?

Store credit is a **monetary value issued by a business** that can be used by customers as payment for goods or services at that business. Store credit typically arises from:

- **Refunds**: Customer returns product, receives credit instead of cash refund
- **Promotional credits**: Business issues credit as incentive or compensation
- **Loyalty rewards**: Customer earns cashback/credit through loyalty program
- **Dispute resolution**: Credit issued to resolve customer complaints

### NxLoy's Positioning

**Critical Strategic Decision**: NxLoy structures store credit as **loyalty/rewards program benefits**, not as purchased gift cards.

**Why This Matters**:
- **ASEAN Advantage**: Loyalty programs receive favorable regulatory treatment across ASEAN
- **Philippines Exemption**: Exempted from strict Gift Check Act (no expiration prohibition)
- **Singapore Licensing**: No Payment Services Act licensing required for limited-purpose loyalty programs
- **Cambodia Simplicity**: Minimal regulation as rewards program vs. prepaid instrument
- **Financial Benefits**: No escheatment obligations (unredeemed balances stay with business)

### Regulatory Scope

Store credit regulations vary significantly by:

**ASEAN Markets** (NxLoy's Primary Operating Environment):
- **Cambodia**: Minimal regulation; general consumer protection laws apply
- **Singapore**: Limited-purpose e-money exempt from licensing; loyalty programs not regulated by MAS
- **Philippines**: Purchased gift cards heavily regulated; **loyalty programs exempt**
- **Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia**: Moderate consumer protection requirements

**US/EU Markets** (Reference for Global Expansion):
- **United States**: Extensive federal (CARD Act) and state-specific regulations
- **European Union**: Member state variation; no EU-wide harmonization
- **Key Difference**: US has complex escheatment laws; ASEAN does not

**Regulatory Factors**:
- **Jurisdiction**: ASEAN, US, EU laws differ significantly
- **Program Structure**: Loyalty program vs. purchased gift card (critical distinction)
- **Issuance Method**: Earned rewards vs. purchased with money
- **Value Characteristics**: Expiration, fees, transferability
- **Multi-Currency**: ASEAN multi-currency considerations

### Compliance Objectives

1. **Legal compliance**: Adhere to ASEAN regulations and best practices
2. **Consumer protection**: Transparent terms, fair treatment, clear disclosures
3. **Financial accuracy**: Proper accounting (IFRS/ASC 606), VAT/GST compliance
4. **Risk mitigation**: Prevent fraud, monitor regulatory changes
5. **Operational clarity**: Clear policies for staff, customers, and merchants
6. **Competitive advantage**: Leverage ASEAN regulatory benefits (no escheatment, loyalty exemptions)

## Legal Classification

### Store Credit vs. Gift Cards

**Critical Distinction**: The legal treatment of store credit differs from gift cards in many jurisdictions.

| Characteristic | Store Credit | Gift Card |
|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Purchase with money** | No (earned/issued) | Yes (bought as product) |
| **CARD Act applies** | Generally NO | YES (US federal law) |
| **State gift card laws** | Varies by state | Generally YES |
| **Expiration allowed** | More permissive | Highly restricted |
| **Fees allowed** | More permissive | Highly restricted |
| **Escheatment** | Varies | Often subject to |

### Types of Store Credit (Legal Perspective)

1. **Refund Credit**
   - Issued when customer returns merchandise
   - May be subject to store return policy
   - Some states require cash refund option for certain values

2. **Promotional Credit**
   - Issued as marketing incentive or compensation
   - Generally fewer restrictions than gift cards
   - More flexibility in expiration and terms

3. **Loyalty Reward Credit**
   - Earned through loyalty program participation
   - Often treated similarly to promotional credit
   - May have different tax treatment

## ASEAN Regulations (Primary Operating Environment)

**Reference Document**: For comprehensive ASEAN regulatory research, see `/docs/compliance/ASEAN-GIFT-CARD-STORE-CREDIT-REGULATIONS.md` (1,352 lines of detailed analysis).

**Key Insight**: ASEAN lacks harmonized gift card/store credit regulations. Each country has distinct requirements, but **loyalty/rewards programs receive favorable treatment** across the region.

### Cambodia - Home Base

**Regulatory Authority**:
- National Bank of Cambodia (NBC)
- Ministry of Commerce
- National Committee on Consumer Protection (NCCP)

**Regulatory Status**: **Minimal gift card-specific regulation**

#### Consumer Protection Framework

**Law on Consumer Protection (2019)**:
- General consumer rights apply to store credit
- Transparency and fair treatment required
- No specific gift card/store credit provisions

#### Store Credit Specific Rules

**Status**: No specific legislation identified

**Applicable Framework**:
- General consumer protection laws
- E-commerce regulations (Law on Electronic Commerce)

**NxLoy Strategy**: Structure as loyalty program, not prepaid instrument

#### Tax Treatment

**Value-Added Tax (VAT)**:
- Standard rate: **10%**
- Applied at redemption (not at credit issuance)
- VAT returns due by 20th of following month

**Example**:
```
Customer earns $10 store credit (promotional reward)
  - No VAT at issuance (not a sale)

Customer redeems $10 credit for $10 product
  - Product retail: $10
  - VAT (10%): $1
  - Customer pays: $1 cash (for VAT)
  OR
  - Customer uses $11 credit ($10 product + $1 VAT)
```

#### Compliance Requirements

**Registration/Licensing**: Not required for limited-purpose store credit (business-specific)

**Disclosures**:
- Clear terms and conditions (Khmer and English)
- Transparency on expiration, restrictions, redemption process

**Record Keeping**:
- Standard business accounting
- VAT documentation
- Loyalty program transaction logs

**Risk Assessment**: **LOW**

**Recommended Actions**:

### Philippines - Loyalty Exemption Strategy

**Regulatory Authority**:
- Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
- Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) - for financial services

**Regulatory Status**: **Most restrictive for purchased gift cards; favorable for loyalty programs**

#### Republic Act No. 10962 - Gift Check Act of 2017

**Signed**: December 19, 2017

**Scope**: All issuers of gift checks, gift certificates, or gift cards (paper, card, code, or other device)

**Key Prohibitions** (for purchased gift cards):
1. Issuing gift checks with expiry dates
2. Imposing expiry date on stored value/credit/balance
3. Refusing to honor unused value/credit/balance

**Penalties**: PHP 500,000 to PHP 1,000,000 for violations

#### CRITICAL EXEMPTION (KEY FOR NXLOY)

**NOT Covered by Gift Check Act**:
1. **Loyalty, rewards, or promotional program gift checks** (as determined by DTI)
2. Coupons/vouchers for discounts or pre-identified goods

**DTI Administrative Order No. 10-04**:
- Gift checks distributed under award, loyalty, or promotional programs **NOT covered**
- DTI has exclusive jurisdiction to determine exemption eligibility

**NxLoy Strategy**: **MUST structure as loyalty/rewards program to qualify for exemption**

#### Compliance Requirements for NxLoy

**CRITICAL DECISION**: Structure as loyalty/rewards program (NOT general gift cards)

**Requirements for Exemption**:
1. **DTI Determination**: Loyalty/rewards programs are exempt
2. **Program Documentation**: Clear loyalty program structure
3. **Marketing**: Position as rewards, NOT purchased gift cards
4. **No Cash Sales**: Do NOT sell "gift cards" for money

**If Structured as Loyalty Program**:
- ✅ Expiration allowed (reasonable terms, e.g., 12-24 months)
- ✅ Fees allowed (though not recommended)
- ✅ Clear terms of service permitted
- ✅ No PHP 500k-1M penalty risk

**If Structured as General Gift Cards**:
- ❌ NO EXPIRATION allowed
- ❌ NO FEES on stored value
- ❌ MUST HONOR full unredeemed value indefinitely
- ❌ HIGH PENALTY RISK (PHP 500k-1M)

**Risk Assessment**: **HIGH IF GIFT CARDS / LOW IF LOYALTY PROGRAM**

**Recommended Actions**:
- [ ] Legal opinion from Philippines counsel on loyalty program classification
- [ ] DTI consultation on program structure (written confirmation)
- [ ] Clear documentation: Loyalty program, not gift card sales

## Expiration Rules

### When Expiration is Allowed

Based on multi-jurisdictional analysis:

**Permitted Expiration**:
1. **Promotional credit** (no purchase required)
2. **Loyalty reward credit** (earned, not purchased)
3. **Compensation credit** (issued for service recovery)
4. **Jurisdictions without specific restrictions**

**Prohibited Expiration**:
1. **Refund credit** in CA, MA, NY, WA
2. **Any credit** if marketed as "gift card"
3. **Purchased gift cards** (see gift card compliance doc)

### Minimum Expiration Periods (When Allowed)

| Jurisdiction | Minimum Duration | Notes |
|--------------|------------------|-------|
| **Federal (US)** | 5 years | If CARD Act applies |
| **California** | N/A | Expiration prohibited for refunds |
| **New York** | 5 years | Gift certificates broadly defined |
| **Texas** | 3 years | For gift cards/certificates |
| **Florida** | No minimum | Must be disclosed |
| **Australia** | 3 years | Gift cards only |
| **Canada (ON)** | N/A | Gift cards cannot expire |

### Recommended Implementation

**Safe Harbor Approach**:
```
Default Expiration Policy:
- Refund credit: NO EXPIRATION (safest compliance)
- Promotional credit: 12 months with clear disclosure
- Loyalty reward credit: 12 months with clear disclosure
- Allow business override: YES (with compliance warnings)

Disclosure Requirements:
- Expiration date shown at issuance
- Email/SMS reminder 30 days before expiration
- Visible in customer account dashboard
- Printed on physical vouchers (if applicable)
```

### Expiration Grace Periods

**Best Practice**:
- 30-day grace period after stated expiration
- Customer service can extend on case-by-case basis
- Log all expiration extensions for audit

---

## Financial Reporting Requirements

### Accounting Treatment

**Store Credit as Liability**

Store credit represents a **deferred revenue liability** on the business's balance sheet:

```
Journal Entry at Issuance:
  DR: Cash / Accounts Receivable (if refund) or Marketing Expense (if promotional)
  CR: Store Credit Liability

Journal Entry at Redemption:
  DR: Store Credit Liability
  CR: Revenue

Journal Entry at Expiration:
  DR: Store Credit Liability
  CR: Breakage Revenue
```

**ASEAN Context**:
- Same accounting treatment applies (IFRS 15 / ASC 606)
- **Major advantage**: No escheatment obligations = can recognize breakage more easily
- Cambodia businesses likely follow IFRS (check local GAAP)
- Singapore businesses must follow SFRS (aligned with IFRS)

### Breakage Revenue Recognition

**Breakage**: Unredeemed store credit that will likely never be redeemed

**Accounting Standards**:
- **IFRS 15** (International / ASEAN): Revenue from Contracts with Customers
- **ASC 606** (US GAAP): Revenue from Contracts with Customers

**Breakage Recognition Criteria**:
1. **Historical data**: Track historical redemption patterns
2. **Statistical modeling**: Estimate breakage based on age of credit
3. **Remote threshold**: Only recognize breakage when redemption is "remote"
4. **Legal compliance**: Cannot recognize breakage if expiration is illegal

**ASEAN Advantage for Breakage Recognition**:
- ✅ **No escheatment conflicts**: Can recognize breakage without government remittance obligations
- ✅ **Flexible expiration** (loyalty programs): Can set reasonable expiration to trigger breakage
- ✅ **Simpler accounting**: No need to reserve for potential escheatment
- ✅ **Better economics**: Breakage stays with business, not remitted to state

**Example Breakage Model (ASEAN)**:
```
Months Since Issuance | Redemption Likelihood | Breakage Estimate | Notes
0-3 months            | 70%                   | 30%               | Active customers
3-6 months            | 50%                   | 50%               | Moderate engagement
6-12 months           | 30%                   | 70%               | Low engagement
12+ months            | 10%                   | 90%               | Approaching expiration
24+ months (expired)  | 0%                    | 100%              | Full breakage recognition

Cambodia/Singapore: Can recognize breakage at expiration (12-24 months)
Philippines: Must use loyalty program structure to allow expiration
```

**Conservative Approach for NxLoy**:
```
Breakage Recognition Policy:
- Track redemption patterns for 6-12 months to establish baseline
- Recognize breakage using Remote Method:
  - At expiration (12 months + 30-day grace period)
  - Based on historical non-redemption rates
- Initial estimate: 15% breakage rate (industry benchmark)
- Review quarterly and adjust based on actual data
```

### Financial Statement Disclosure

**Required Disclosures (ASEAN)**:
1. **Balance sheet**: Total store credit liability by currency (USD, KHR, SGD, etc.)
2. **Income statement**: Breakage revenue (if recognized)
3. **Notes**: Accounting policy for store credit (IFRS 15 compliance)
4. **Notes**: Redemption patterns and breakage estimates
5. **Notes**: Expiration policy and customer notification process
6. **Notes**: Multi-currency considerations (if applicable)
7. **Notes**: NO escheatment obligations (ASEAN advantage)

**Example Financial Statement Note (Cambodia)**:
```
Note 10: Store Credit Liability

The Company operates a loyalty program in which customers earn store credit
through purchases and promotional activities. Store credit is recorded as a
deferred revenue liability and recognized as revenue upon redemption.

The Company recognizes breakage revenue on unredeemed store credit when the
likelihood of redemption becomes remote, based on historical redemption patterns.
Store credit expires 12 months after issuance, with a 30-day grace period.

As of December 31, 2025:
- Store credit liability:           $50,000 (KHR 200,000,000)
- Store credits issued (year):      $120,000
- Store credits redeemed (year):    $85,000
- Breakage recognized (year):       $18,000
- Average breakage rate:            15%

The Company is not subject to escheatment laws in Cambodia. Unredeemed balances
benefit the Company upon expiration.
```

### Audit Requirements

**Documentation Needed (ASEAN)**:
- Store credit issuance records
- Redemption transaction logs
- Breakage calculation methodology
- Historical redemption data and trends
- Expiration policy and customer communications
- Legal compliance review (loyalty program structure)
- Multi-currency reconciliation (if applicable)
- **NO escheatment filings** (not applicable in ASEAN)

**Cambodia-Specific**:
- VAT compliance documentation (10% at redemption)
- Khmer language terms of service
- NBC regulatory correspondence (if any)

**Singapore-Specific**:
- GST compliance documentation (9% at redemption)
- MAS exemption confirmation (limited-purpose loyalty program)
- SFRS (Singapore FRS) compliance

---

## Tax Implications

### ASEAN Tax Treatment (Primary Operating Environment)

**General Rule**: VAT/GST is collected **at redemption**, not at issuance

#### Cambodia - VAT Treatment (10%)

**Promotional Credit Issuance**:
```
Business issues $10 store credit (loyalty reward):
  - No VAT at issuance (not a sale)
  - Recorded as marketing expense or deferred revenue
```

**Redemption**:
```
Customer buys $50 product using $10 credit:
  - Product value: $50
  - VAT (10%): $5
  - Customer payment:
    Option A: $10 credit + $40 cash + $5 VAT = $55 total
    Option B: $11 credit (if credit covers VAT) + $44 cash = $55 total

Recommended: Option A (customer pays VAT separately)
- Clearer accounting
- Credit value = product value (not tax-inclusive)
```

**Refund Credit**:
```
Original Sale:
  - Customer pays $100 + $10 VAT = $110
  - Customer returns product
  - Refund: $100 store credit + $10 VAT refund (cash)

Redemption:
  - Customer uses $100 credit for new $100 product
  - VAT (10%): $10
  - Customer pays: $10 VAT (cash or additional credit if full refund)
```

**VAT Compliance**:
- VAT returns due by 20th of following month
- Store credit redemption = taxable supply
- Record VAT at redemption, not issuance

#### Singapore - GST Treatment (9%)

**Multi-Purpose Voucher (MPV) Classification**:
Store credit from loyalty programs typically treated as MPV:
- GST charged when voucher is **redeemed**, not when issued
- If loyalty credit expires unredeemed, no GST on breakage revenue

**Example**:
```
Customer earns $20 store credit:
  - No GST at issuance

Redemption:
  - Customer buys $20 product
  - GST (9%): $1.80
  - Total: $21.80
  - Payment: $20 credit + $1.80 cash (for GST)

OR (alternative):
  - Customer uses $21.80 credit (if system allows GST-inclusive credits)
```

**Breakage Revenue**:
```
Store credit expires unredeemed:
  - No GST on breakage revenue
  - Breakage = service that was never provided
  - Consult IRAS for specific guidance
```

#### Philippines - VAT Treatment

**If operating in Philippines** (loyalty program structure):
- VAT rate: TBD (check current rate)
- Same principle: Tax at redemption, not issuance
- Loyalty program structure ensures flexibility

#### Other ASEAN Markets

| Country | VAT/GST Rate | Tax Treatment | Notes |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| **Vietnam** | VAT (varies) | At redemption | New e-commerce laws apply |
| **Thailand** | VAT 7% | At redemption | Standard VAT rules |
| **Malaysia** | SST/GST | At redemption | Check current tax regime |
| **Indonesia** | VAT 11% | At redemption | Digital service tax may apply |

### ASEAN Income Tax Treatment

**For Businesses**:

1. **Issuance**: Not taxable income (liability created)
2. **Redemption**: Revenue recognized and taxable when credit redeemed
3. **Breakage**: Taxable as income when recognized (major advantage: no escheatment offset)
4. **Promotional credit**: Deductible as marketing expense in most jurisdictions

**Cambodia Corporate Tax**:
- Rate: 20% on taxable income
- Breakage revenue = taxable income
- Marketing expenses (promotional credits) = deductible

**Singapore Corporate Tax**:
- Rate: 17% (standard), progressive rates for first SGD 300k
- Breakage revenue = taxable income
- GST-registered businesses follow MRV rules

**For Customers (Generally)**:

1. **Refund credit**: Not taxable (return of purchase price)
2. **Promotional credit**: Generally not taxable in ASEAN (treated as discount/rebate)
3. **Loyalty reward credit**: Not taxable (marketing incentive, not income)

**Key Difference from US**:
- ASEAN generally does NOT treat promotional rewards as taxable income to recipients
- No equivalent to US IRS Form 1099 requirements for $600+ promotional credits
- Simpler compliance for both business and customers

### US Sales Tax Treatment (Reference Only)

**General Rule**: Sales tax is collected **at redemption**, not at issuance

#### Refund Credit
```
Original Sale:
  - Customer pays $100 + $8 sales tax = $108
  - Customer returns product
  - Refund: $100 store credit + $8 tax refund OR $108 total credit (varies by state)

Redemption:
  - Customer uses $100 credit to buy new product
  - Sales tax calculated on $100 = $8
  - Customer pays $8 sales tax (or uses additional credit if full refund issued)
```

#### Promotional Credit
```
Issuance:
  - Business issues $10 promotional credit
  - No sales tax at issuance

Redemption:
  - Customer buys $50 product
  - Applies $10 credit
  - Sales tax calculated on $50 (not $40)
  - Tax = $4 (assuming 8% rate)
  - Customer pays: $50 - $10 credit + $4 tax = $44
```

**State Variations**:
- **Some states**: Tax only on net amount after credit
- **Other states**: Tax on full retail price before credit
- **NxLoy approach**: Configure per state tax rules (if serving US customers)

### US Income Tax Treatment (Reference Only)

**For Businesses**:

1. **Issuance**: Generally not taxable income
2. **Redemption**: Revenue recognized when credit is redeemed
3. **Breakage**: Taxable as income when recognized
4. **Promotional credit**: May be deductible marketing expense

**For Customers**:

1. **Refund credit**: Not taxable (return of purchase price)
2. **Promotional credit**: May be taxable as gift/prize if over IRS thresholds ($600+)
3. **Loyalty reward credit**: Generally not taxable (rebate/discount treatment)

**IRS Form 1099 Requirements**:
- If promotional credit exceeds $600/year per customer: May require 1099-MISC
- Consult US tax professional for specific circumstances

## Consumer Protection

### Required Disclosures

**At Issuance**:
- Credit amount
- Expiration date (if applicable)
- Restrictions on use
- Non-transferability (if applicable)
- Non-refundable for cash (except where required)
- Customer service contact

**Example Disclosure**:
```
Store Credit Issued: $25.00
Issued: 2025-11-09
Expires: 2026-11-09 (12 months)
Restrictions: Valid for merchandise only. Not valid for gift card purchases.
Non-transferable. Not redeemable for cash except where required by law.
Questions? Contact support@business.com or (555) 123-4567
```

### Transparency Requirements

**Customer Account Dashboard**:
- Current store credit balance
- Transaction history (issuance and redemptions)
- Expiration dates prominently displayed
- Download/print transaction records

**Email Notifications**:
- Issuance confirmation
- Redemption confirmation
- Expiration reminders (30 days, 7 days, 1 day before)
- Balance updates

### Prohibited Practices

**Cannot**:
- Reduce credit value over time (dormancy fees) in most jurisdictions
- Expire credit without clear disclosure
- Charge fees without disclosure
- Make redemption unreasonably difficult
- Discriminate in redemption (must honor like cash)

**Must**:
- Honor advertised terms
- Provide reasonable redemption methods
- Maintain records for audit
- Comply with accessibility requirements (ADA/AODA)

---

## Data Security Requirements

### PCI DSS Considerations

**Does PCI DSS Apply?**

Store credit is **NOT payment card data**, but:
- If stored alongside payment data, PCI scope may extend
- Security best practices still apply
- Tokenization recommended

**Security Requirements**:
1. **Encryption at rest**: Store credit balances encrypted in database
2. **Encryption in transit**: HTTPS/TLS for all transactions
3. **Access controls**: Role-based access to credit adjustment functions
4. **Audit logging**: All credit issuance/redemption/adjustments logged
5. **Regular audits**: Quarterly review of credit transactions

### Data Privacy

**GDPR Compliance** (EU customers):
- Store credit is personal data
- Customer has right to access, rectify, delete
- Right to erasure: Complex if unredeemed balance exists
- Data portability: Provide credit history in machine-readable format

**CCPA Compliance** (California customers):
- Disclose data collection practices
- Allow opt-out of data sale (not applicable for internal credit)
- Provide access to store credit data on request

### Fraud Prevention

**Risk Areas**:
1. **Unauthorized issuance**: Staff or system abuse
2. **Duplicate redemption**: Same credit used multiple times
3. **Social engineering**: Fraudsters tricking staff into issuing credit
4. **Account takeover**: Stolen accounts used to redeem credit

**Mitigation Controls**:
- Multi-factor authentication for credit issuance
- Approval workflows for credits over threshold (e.g., $100)
- Redemption code validation (unique, single-use codes)
- Velocity checks (unusual redemption patterns)
- Audit trail for all credit transactions

## Escheatment & Unclaimed Property

**🎯 CRITICAL ASEAN ADVANTAGE**: **ASEAN countries have NO escheatment/unclaimed property laws**

This is a **major financial and operational advantage** for NxLoy operating in ASEAN markets compared to US/EU:
- **No obligation** to remit unredeemed balances to government
- **Simplified accounting**: Can recognize breakage revenue without escheatment complications
- **No compliance burden**: No annual reporting, due diligence, or remittance requirements
- **Better economics**: Unredeemed balances benefit the business, not the state

**This section applies ONLY to businesses serving US/EU customers**. For ASEAN operations, escheatment is **not applicable**.

---

### What is Escheatment? (US/EU Context)

**Definition**: Escheatment is the process by which unclaimed property is turned over to the state.

**Applicability** (US Only): Unredeemed store credit may be considered unclaimed property if:
1. Credit has been inactive for statutory period (3-5 years)
2. Business cannot locate customer
3. State law requires escheatment of store credits

**ASEAN Status**: **Not applicable** - No ASEAN country has escheatment laws

### State Escheatment Laws

**Dormancy Periods by State**:

| State | Dormancy Period | Store Credit Covered? | Notes |
|-------|----------------|----------------------|-------|
| **California** | 3 years | YES | Gift cards and unredeemed credits |
| **New York** | 5 years | YES | Gift certificates and credits |
| **Texas** | 5 years | Varies | Depends on credit type |
| **Florida** | 5 years | Varies | May exclude promotional credits |
| **Delaware** | 5 years | YES | Aggressively enforces |

**Exemptions**:
- Some states exempt promotional credits
- Some states exempt credits under de minimis threshold ($25-$50)
- Loyalty program credits may be exempt in some jurisdictions

### Escheatment Compliance Process

**Annual Requirements**:

1. **Due Diligence** (60-120 days before report due):
   - Attempt to contact customers with dormant credits
   - Email/postal mail to last known address
   - Document all contact attempts

2. **Reporting** (Typically November 1):
   - File unclaimed property report with each state
   - List customer names, addresses, and credit amounts
   - Submit electronically via state portal

3. **Remittance** (With report or by deadline):
   - Remit unredeemed credit amounts to state
   - States hold funds for customers to claim
   - Business no longer has liability

4. **Record Retention**:
   - Maintain escheatment records for 7-10 years
   - Provide to auditors on request

**Example Timeline**:
```
July 1: Identify all credits dormant for 3+ years (assuming CA rules)
August 1-31: Send due diligence letters to customers
September 1-30: Compile escheatment report
November 1: File report and remit funds to California
```

### Implementation in NxLoy

**Database Requirements**:
- Track `lastActivityDate` for each store credit
- Flag credits approaching dormancy period
- Store customer contact information for due diligence
- Generate escheatment reports by state

**Automated Workflows**:
- Monthly job: Identify dormant credits
- Quarterly job: Send reminder emails to inactive customers
- Annual job: Generate escheatment reports
- Integration with state reporting systems (e.g., NAUPA)
